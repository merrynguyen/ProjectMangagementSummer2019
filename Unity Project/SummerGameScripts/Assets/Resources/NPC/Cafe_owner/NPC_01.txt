~Have you noticed anything or anyone suspicious?<

~I don't know... I mean food keeps disappearing from the storage room. Now we always have to keep the back room locked.+

I think its that sneaky _____. She\He is always getting into others stuff and we can't seem to stop him\her.<

Me@

~I know what you mean. No matter what I do ___ always finds a way to get into new trouble. Anything else?<

Cafe Owner@

~I think I heard that Mayor Merrtabb was having some "paranormal" activity going on at her place.+
 ^
Of course, this isn't anything new... she always has something new and strange happening in her life.+
 ^
But what can I say, strange people attract strange things.<

~Well, thanks for your help. I'll look into it.>
