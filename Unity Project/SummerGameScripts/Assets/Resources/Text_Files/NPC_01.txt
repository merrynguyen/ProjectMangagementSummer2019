~Hey bud, what can I get for you today?<

You@
~Oh, I'm not here for a drink, I need answers.<

Cafe Owner@
~I'll give you what I can.<

You@
~Have you noticed anything or anyone suspicious?<

Cafe Owner@
~I don't know... I mean food keeps disappearing from the storage room. Now we always have to keep the back room locked.*
I think its that sneaky _____. She\He is always getting into others stuff and we can't seem to stop him\her.<

You@
~I know what you mean. No matter what I do ___ always finds a way to get into new trouble. Anything else?<

Cafe Owner@
~I think I heard that Mayor Merrtabb was having some "paranormal" activity going on at her place.*
Of course, this isn't anything new... she always has something new and strange happening in her life.*
But what can I say, strange people attract strange things.<

You@
~Well, thanks for your help. I'll look into it.>
